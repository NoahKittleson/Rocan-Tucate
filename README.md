#_README for Rocan Tucate_#
###Created by Noah Kittleson###
 
##**Overview**
 Quick game that I put together to test out basic video and keyboard input with SFML.  Press Space bar to turn the rotate the toucan and raise your score arbitrarily.  1 or 2 player mode available
 
##**Setup**
I have purposefully left out many of the assets so that not _all_ of my work can be stolen.  Unfortunately this means that the code will not compile and is for purely demonstrational purposes.
 
##**Technologies used**
* C++
* SFML
